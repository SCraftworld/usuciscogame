# usuciscogame
Commemorative unfinished game about (mostly) fictional life in USU Cisco Academy

## Language
Russian.

## State
Unfinished.

## How to run
1. Run start.cmd to start simple nodejs http server (or host it any other way, only static files serving required);
2. Open localhost:777/main.html in browser.

## Trivia
* Written in summer 2013 as a inner joke for teaching stuff of Cisco Academy in Ural State University. Hence it contains references understood by 3-5 people and probably shouldn't be played by anyone else;
* Minor redactions applied to published version in order to remove personal and/or possibly offensive information;
* Pure JS/CSS/HTML mix with a drop of JQuery.
